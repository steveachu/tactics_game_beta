Control the player unit by using the arrow keys.

The map is currently a 2D character array, with different characters representing different tiles.

There is a Tile class implemented (Tile.java) that defines each tile type. Currently deciding which direction to take the game.

Currently, the main character is animated with 6 frames. The water is also animated with two frames. Current code is very experimental, since I am still conflicted on where to take the game.

Thanks to my brother for help with the sprites.
